# KO-Consequences
Real Handcuffs and Knockout Framework Mod Integration

Requirements: 
Real Handcuffs
Knockout Framework

This mod creates concequences for getting knocked out through KO framework. Now you may find that you wake up with a shiny new collar, or an inescapable pair of handcuffs. You can hope to get lucky, or you can hunt down the bastard who locked this stuff on you.
